# Find Vowel Positions

Write a function that takes a string s, iterates through it, and collects all 0-based positions of vowels in it to an array.

Note that you should not use any JavaScript built-in methods to solve this task.

For example, console.log(findVowelPositions("Hello WORLD")) should output [1, 4, 7]. Here, 'e' is a vowel, and its position in the string "Hello" is 1. 'o' is also a vowel, and its position is 4. The last vowel is O at position 7. Vowels are defined as any of the following characters: ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'].
